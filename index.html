                    Sea Otter Groups</br>
                    Sea otters float in what we call rafts. These rafts are usually gender-based, meaning boy sea otters
                    like to hang out together and girl sea otters like to hang out together. Female sea otters raise
                    their pups without assistance from males. Sometimes sea otters like to hold hands. Holding hands
                    allows sea otters to keep their delicate paw pads warm.

                    Sea Otter Pups</br>
                    Sea otter pups are born with a buoyant fur that does not allow them to sink. They float like corks
                    on top of the water unable to dive and therefore, are completely dependent on the mother sea otter.
                    Sea otter pup fur is known as a lanugo. A lanugo is a very soft, downy hair that develops in humans
                    as well as animals. Sea otter pup fur is shed by the time they are approximately 13 weeks old. Sea
                    otter pups are born with 26 baby teeth; 10 of which are visible.

                    A Sea Otter's Diet</br>
                    Sea otters eat frequently throughout the day. Unlike other marine mammals, sea otters have no
                    blubber, so they must consume 25-30% of their body weight every day in order to survive in their
                    cold Pacific Ocean habitat. Sea otters eat mainly invertebrates and bivalve animals. </br>Some of
                    their favorite meals consist of: sea urchins, abalone, clams, crabs, mussels, sea stars, and fat
                    innkeeper worms.
